\chapter{Future work and limitations}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we present the limitations and possible improvements of FrDataFlow. 
The current implementation is rather limited in its functionality because we wanted to focus on the mapping layer and the possibilities of parallelization using the dataflow engine.
However, multiple improvements can still be made. The signal graphs that can be made in FrDataFlow are still static, e.g. it does not allow the dynamic creation of new signals, the filtering of values or just generally manipulating the timing of value propagation. Every signal always has to emit a value for every set of incoming values. While this already allows for a rich set of programs, these manipulations would be necessary to implement any non trivial program using FrDataFlow.

\section{Dynamically creating signals}

One of the common patterns in reactive programming is the dynamic creation of new signals based on some state or external input. Imagine a button which starts a timer. When this button is pressed, a timer should start running and continuously update the screen with the elapsed time.

First of all, this button can be represented as a signal of clicks. Every click is essentially an event, which in terms of reactive programming can be represented as an event being emitted by a signal.

A timer is also a perfect fit for a signal: it is a signal that continuously emits the current elapsed seconds. The tricky part however is that we only want to create this timer when the button is pressed. That means we want to lift the button signal and create a new timer signal only when it is pressed. Maybe another button click stops the timer, or starts a second one, but that is outside the scope of this example.

This pattern of dynamically creating signals is quite common in reactive programming, and unfortunately impossible in FrDataFlow today. A possible improvement would be to enable this, which would mean the signal would have to be added to the topologically sorted signals and be translated to a dataflow node. This would also mean that any existing dataflow nodes upon which this new signal depends would have to be updated to also generate tokens for this new node. Similarly, upon destroying signals, this node and all the references to it would have to be updated. The requirement for a static graph is currently one of the limitations of the dataflow model we use, but it would technically be possible, although it would introduce a considerable amount of bookkeeping overhead. 

\subsection{Filtering}

Another common practice is filtering of signals, only letting values through which satisfy a certain predicate. Our current implementation of FrDataFlow models signals as a mapping function which takes a set of inputs and produces a new value for every updated set. Filtering would introduce the possibility of not propagating a value at all if certain criteria are not met. In essence, a signal would no longer provide a lambda that has to return a value, but a lambda that can push values into a type of sink when it wants to. This refactoring would allow for a whole category of powerful constructs, such as taking only the first n values, throttling signals, etc. 

An example visualization of the filter function in RxJs can be seen in figure  \ref{fig:futurework-filtering-filter}.

\end{figure}

We see at the top a signal which produces a stream of numbers. If we create a new signal that filters these numbers using the filter function, we get a new stream of numbers that only contains those that satisfied the predicate. When the number 0 is pushed into the signal lambda, it does not propagate it into the sink of the child signal, which means the value does not go through. 

To implement this pattern in our mapping layer, we would have to ensure that dataflow nodes don't always have to produce new tokens when they are invoked, and a way for nodes to indicate when this should happen or not. However, there is no technical reason why the dataflow engine should not be able to handle this: it is simply the presence of tokens that determines which nodes are invoked, so not emitting these tokens would essentially implement the filtering behavior we have described.


\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter we have shown how FrDataFlow is still a basic language that does not support some powerful concepts such as the dynamic creation of signals or the filtering of values.
If these concepts were to be introduced, they would allow for an implementation of most of the techniques commonly found in other reactive libraries or languages.

This initial version of FrDataFlow has focused mostly on the practical mapping layer from reactive programming to the dataflow model. There are however no immediate technical shortcomings that should prevent us from implementing the modifications presented in this chapter.
