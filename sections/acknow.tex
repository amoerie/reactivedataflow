\section*{Acknowledgements}

Over the course of this dissertation, I have had the pleasure of working with three excellent people who helped me put together this research in a structured, qualitative manner. Therefore, I would like to sincerely express my gratitude towards Mathijs, Florian and Thierry for their continuous feedback, valuable insights, proofreading and also the time they have spent over the past year to make this paper a quality endeavour. A special shout out goes to Mathijs, who patiently and with great clarity worked me through the intricacies of the dataflow execution model and contributed greatly to the practical setup of the implementation. Briefly put, this dissertation would not have been possible without the support of these people.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Wolfgang De Meuter for his brilliant lectures on algorithms, data structures and functional programming which expanded my foundational understanding of computer science and permanently enriched my professional expertise.

On a more personal note, a special word of thanks goes to my significant other, Joey, for all her unwavering love, support and understanding throughout these last years. Finally, I thank my parents, who are always there for me and never fail to support me in any of my endeavours.
